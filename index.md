# Casey Jenson

I am the program assistant at [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/our-team/casey-jenson) and [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/) and a Professional Research Associate Scientist at [CIRES](https://cires.colorado.edu/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a member of the North Central Regional Invasive Species and Climate Change Network team ([RISCC](https://nc-riscc.org/)).

## Background
I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Envrionmental Science and Graphic Design from [Concordia College](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/) in December 2020. 

I am currently a graduate student in The University of Colorado's Master of Science in Environmental Sciences program. 

My background and interests are in: 
- Invasive Species Biogeography
- Ecology
- Water Quality
- Science Communication

I've also led several research projects within a range of topics including,  microplastics, conservation, evolutionary biology, and marine science. 

## Events
Below are notable workshops and trainings that I've helped develop & coordinate:
- [2024 NASA-ESIIL](https://esiil.org/hyr-sense) Hyperspectral and Thermal Remote Sensing for Environmental Justice
- [2024 ESIIL Innovation Summit](https://esiil.org/innovation-summit): Big Data for Environmental Resilience and Adaptation 
- 2023 - 2024 NC RISCC Ecological Transformation Workshop Series
- 2023 ESIIL Innovation Summit
