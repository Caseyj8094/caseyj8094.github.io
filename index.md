# Casey Jenson

I am the program assistant at [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/our-team/casey-jenson) and [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/) and a Professional Research Associate at [CIRES](https://cires.colorado.edu/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a member of the North Central Regional Invasive Species and Climate Change ([RISCC](https://nc-riscc.org/)) Network.

## Background
I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Envrionmental Science and Graphic Design from [Concordia College](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/) in Dec 2020. 

In the fall of 2024 I will be attending The University of Colorado's Master of Science in Environmental Sciences program. 

My background and interests are in: 
- Invasive Species Biogeography
- Ecology
- Water quality
- Science Communication

I've also led several research projects in microplastics, ecology, conservation, invasive speices biogeography, and marine science. 

## Biography
I was born and raised in the lakes region of Minnesota where I gained a passion for science behind our environment. Currently, I reside in Colorado where I am gaining firsthand knowledge of the Front Range region of the Rockies.
