# Casey Jenson
I am currently a graduate student in The University of Colorado's Master of Science in Environmental Sciences program. 
Some of my recent projects inclue: 
- Thermal sensing of Green Infrastructure in Denver, CO.
- Assessing the Impact of Urban Heat Islands on Bumble Bee Populations in Colorado.


I am also a Research Associate Scientist at [CIRES](https://cires.colorado.edu/) and the program assistant at [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/our-team/casey-jenson) and [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/) and at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a member of the North Central Regional Invasive Species and Climate Change Network team ([RISCC](https://nc-riscc.org/)). I am currently working with the USFS on identifying fire weather conditions.


## Background
I earned my Bachelor's in Envrionmental Science & Sustainability from [Concordia College](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/). 

I have also completed several certificate courses in remote sensing, and data analytics:
- 2025 Data Science: R Basics, [Harvard University EdX] (https://home.edx.org/)
- 2024 Intro to Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) Hyperspectral Observations for Water Quality Monitoring, [NASA ARSET](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-introduction-plankton-aerosol-cloud-ocean-ecosystem-pace)
- 2024 Invasive Species Monitoring with Remote Sensing Certificate, [NASA ARSET](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-invasive-species-monitoring-remote-sensing)

My background and interests are in: 
- Ecology
- Invasive Species Management
- Science Communication
- Green Infrastructure

I've also led several research projects within a range of topics including:  conservation biology, evolutionary biology, marine science, and urban heat islands.  Lastly, I am skilled in data analysis in R and Geographic Information Systems, ArcGISPro

This map was created using Google My maps for GEOG 5230 Hazard Mitigation and Vulnerability Assessments. 
The meeting spots indicate gathering locations in the event of an earthquake and are >500 feet from the Wellness Center, as per Auraria Campus Emergency Procedures.
